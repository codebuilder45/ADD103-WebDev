    <p>Dogs rule. They have varied personalities. A good frisbee or tennis ball toss with the right dog is fun.</p>

    <h3>Land Conservation</h3>
    <h2>Wetland</h2>
    <h2>Oak Savana</h2>
    <p>Last semester, I volunteered a number of times to work with a team of people removing invasive species that did not belong.
       Vines had to be removed from trees. Most of the unwanted foliage has to be burned.
